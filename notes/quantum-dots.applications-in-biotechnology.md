On the 5th of December '23, Dr Matthew Booth who is a Senior Lecturer of experimental physics at the University of Lincoln and an expert researcher in the field, dived into the fascinating world of quantum dots. As a reader you may be wondering "What on earth is a *quantum dot*?".  Fair question, indeed.

Let's start with the basics. A quantum dot (QD) is a semiconductor-crystal of tiny dimensions. To paint a picture, you might fit up to five of these crystals into the width of a single strand of DNA [Nanosys]. From television screens to LASERs; cancer diagnoses to cancer treatments; there are wide, swathing applications of this technology.

To truly understand what a QD is, we first need to learn about electrons, excitons and semiconductors. Semiconductors are midway between a conductor and insulator and the atoms in these materials can have a range of energies. Manufacturing certain types of semiconductor into electronic chips, say those in your pocket, only allows very specific energies which makes them useful for switches in logical circuits.

Imagine a familiar light switch; given enough force you can flip the switch and turn on the light.

When light waves have enough energy, they *switch on* a QD and a new particle is born into existence. The humble exciton. Except scientists are a bit unsure about whether it can be considered to be a particle… the exciton is in fact a gap where an electron should be. To cut a rather long explanation of *quantum confinement* short: shrinking our semiconductor means that our switch is much more precise in deciding to be turned on or off. So, the QD is either on or off; being picky with which light is and is not allowed gives QDs their striking optical qualities.

Shining one of these particular colours of light on a vessel containing QDs makes them glow brightly. The Nobel Prize Laureate and celebrated professor Heiner Linke of Lund University, Sweden explains how the old way to produce particular colours, before the availability of quantum dots, was tedious and slow to progress.

But for QDs we don't need to invent a new molecule or element, we only need to form smaller or larger crystals.

**More than surface level**
If you start making things on a tiny scale then you find that the surface area of an object scales down more slowly than the volume it occupies. QDs are grown in a lab within a liquid solution; they begin to form the crystals undergo strain due to surface tension from the liquid, so some simply disintegrate under the force. This means that, for most crystals, it is near-impossible to achieve specific colours of light. Dr Matthew Booth explains

In balancing these two effects, we find that only certain crystal sizes are energetically efficient to produce. Some quantum dots are simply too small to make.

**Dots! What are they good for?**
As it turns out quite a lot of things, actually. In cancer imaging, they replace radioactive substances with crystals that are easily dispelled by the human body to highlight cancer structure and growth [Smith]. In developmental biology, they are used as a platform for attaching to embryonic cells to discover how mammals grow in the womb [Lin]. Also, in molecular therapy, they are have been used to heat tissue locally to kill cancer cells. The quantum dots can be excited using light causing them to heat up and destroy the cells they were targeted for.

Some critics, however, fear that this technology could spell doom for us all. The knowledge of nanotoxicity is in its early stages, and calls for a heavy body of research to determine the health effects of nanoparticles such as quantum dots. Last September, Dr James Giordano, Chief of the Neuroethics Studies Program in the Pellegrino Center for Clinical Bioethics, delivered a seminar to experts at Georgetown University where he spoke out about possible threats to national security.

That's not all, either. Some bioethicists have voiced their profound concerns regarding 'quantum dot tattoos', which may someday hold an invisible medical record on your skin for use by healthcare workers. A group of scientists at MIT released a [research article](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/scitranslmed.aay7162) in 2019 describing the process in which quantum dots are injected under the skin in a particular pattern to be later scanned using a modified smartphone [MIT]. Their hope is that this will ultimately be used in developing countries where charity vaccination programs struggle to identify which local residents have already had the vaccine administered [Mehar].

# Seminar notes
## What are they?

### Excitons in semiconductors

Semiconductors are halfway between a conductor and insulator. Semiconductors have an unusual property, they feature a ‘bandgap’, energy levels which atoms cannot exist in. Imagine a switch; given enough force you can flip the switch and turn on the light. Given enough input energy the atoms will become excited.

When the switch is flipped on our atom a new particle is born into existence. The humble exciton. Except not really… the exciton is in fact a gap where an electron should be.

When we shrink our semiconductor crystal we have excitons that freely follow the excited electron. This is a powerful technique that allows for large energy output.

### Density of states

The electrons in our system have a range of energies. In a 3D crystals these energy levels are continuous and take any values. In zero-dimensions, however, the energies take discrete values. Density of states refers to the number of electrons in each of the discrete energy bands.

### Particle in a box

As we decrease the size of our potential well, the energy states become more separated and the energy levels are much, much larger.

### The Brus equation

Describes a jack-in-the-box effect for quantum dots.

## How are they made?

Two main methods:

- Colloidal (in solution)
    - Solvothermal
    - Microwave assisted
    - Plasma assisted
- On substrate
    - Molecular beam epitaxy

### Limitations

For most crystals it is near-impossible to achieve specific colours/wavelengths of light.

> When you form the crystal you make a minor phase from a major phase

It _costs_ energy to have an interface between the crystal and the suspending solution. It _saves_ energy to create a solid volume in solution. Balancing these two energy effects we find that it only certain crystal sizes are energetically efficient to produce.

> Some quantum dots are simply too small to make

## It’s the surface, stupid!

The smaller the volume of an object, the greater the surface area of that same object. The edges of the dots can be totally neglected because any electron can ‘flip’ onto the other side. We essentially treat these quantum dots as an infinite grid of crystal lattice.

## Applications

Source: Multicolor quantum dots for molecular diagnostics of cancer by Andrew M Smith

Multiplexed cancer imaging. Quantum dots can be inserted into cancer cells to highlight growth and structure.

- The benefit is that they are not radioactive and are easily dispelled by the body.

Bioconjugation platform. The quantum dots can be used as a platform for attaching certain molecules that target specific cell types.

The colour tuning properties enable them to be designed to emit very similar wavelengths to the natural emission properties of human tissue.

They can be used to heat tissue very locally e.g. to target cancer cells. The quantum dots can be excited with light so they heat up and destroy the cells in which they are contained.
